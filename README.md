# globot

With GPT-4V, we can finally complete the original vision of [natbot](https://github.com/nat/natbot).

Help solve general agents by contributing to this repo!

**Ideas for Improvement**
- Scrolling (easy to add, but likely to cause divergence)
- Better context management (learning from mistakes, more descriptive history)
- Masking the image with node IDs
- Better DOM parsing (please submit issues/PRs!)
- More explicit planning
- Data collection and fine-tuning

*NOTE:* Remember to use the latest release of the openai API for the vision model:
```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
```
